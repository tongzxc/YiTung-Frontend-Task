                    <p>
                    I was exposed to the technology field when I was in my final year of my undergraduate studies. 
                    It was a collaborative project between NUS and various organisations.
                    I had to work with 4 of my peers to solve a real life problem provided by the organisation we were attached to.
                    It brand new experience for me as this project required coding but I had no prior knowledge in python. 
                    However, I actually enjoyed the process of gaining knowledge from scratch and successfully run the script. 
                    I love the sense of satisfaction that I get when I succeed in something, especially if I doubted myself initially.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    For my final year project, my thesis was on promoting women leaders in the STEM industries. 
                    While gathering information, I managed to interview 3 respectable women who are leaders and/or founders in the technology field.
                    I was so inspired by their dedication to their work and the female community and I aspire to be like them where I can influence and be a role model for younger females.
                    Even till date, I have also joined other female tech community groups and I have supported and attended some of their activities and courses.

                    <h4>Why do I want to be part of this bootcamp? (part 2 of 2)</h4>
                    <p>
                    After graduation, I worked in a logistics industry under a graduate program but I quickly realised that it's not the industry for me.
                    In general, I prefer doing more hands on activities such as coding, building a website or analysing data.
                    It was something that my previous job could not offer. 
                    I decided to change my career and venture into the technology field by taking up courses in python first as I had some experience. 
                    However, I realised that in order to secure a job in the technology field, I need to show my profiency and capability since I have no technical experience.
                    As I am still relatively new to the technology industry, I wanted to try out different aspects of it and narrow my options from there.
                    Through this bootcamp, I hope to gain some technical skills to build up my portfolio, as well as connections from the industry to kickstart my career.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    I hope that through my hard work and dedication, I will be able to eventually secure a job in the technology field and doing something that I am passionate about. 
                    Once I am proficient enough, I also hope to mentor and inspire future generations of females! &#128522;
